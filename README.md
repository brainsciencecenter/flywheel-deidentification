# flywheel-deidentification

Documentation and utilities for checking de-identification of data uploaded to Flywheel.

The profiles here are applied automatically users uploading DICOM data. The [site
profile](profiles/PennBrainScienceCenter/de-id_upenn_Penn_BSC_profile_v3.0_20201111A.yaml)
is now applied automatically on import with `fw ingest dicom`, or via the web interface.

Attempting to de-identify the data by any other means will raise an error. Ingest dicom
data with the `fw ingest dicom` command, without `--de-identify` or any profiles in config
file.

**Do not use older versions of the code with `fw import dicom` to import data to
Flywheel**.

If uploading data manually, or from a new source, test and verify the de-identification.
First use `fw deid test` (see the [profile
page](profiles/PennBrainScienceCenter/README.md) for details).
Then upload a single session and check carefully. Notify the admins of any problems.

If you require a different de-identification profile than the site profile, please contact
the site admin Gaylord Holder to discuss options.


## How the de-identification works

The [site
profile](profiles/PennBrainScienceCenter/de-id_upenn_Penn_BSC_profile_v3.0_20201111A.yaml)
removes direct identifiers and several indirect identifiers not normally required for
research use. Certain indirect identifiers important for research (such as PatientWeight)
are retained.

Data received from the scanner connectors is automatically de-identified using this
protocol.

Data imported via the web "DICOM Upload" interface also has this profile applied, unless a
project-level profile is present. Contact the site admin if you need customized
de-identification.

Data ingested via the `fw ingest dicom` command also applies the site profile.

Older versions of the `fw` program allow the use of `fw import dicom`, which require a
profile on the command line. **Do not use `fw import dicom` to import data to Flywheel**.


## Limitations of automated de-identification

The [site
profile](profiles/PennBrainScienceCenter/de-id_upenn_Penn_BSC_profile_v3.0_20201111A.yaml)
removes standard dicom tags that are designed to contain direct identifiers. It also
removes some indirect identifiers that might give clues to the patient's identity or other
sensitive information like pregnancy status. However, there are some limitations to
automated de-identification.

Data uploaded manually, or from an external scanner, should be tested and checked thoroughly.

Potential de-identification failures may arise from:

* Private DICOM tags. Private tags are **NOT** modified by the site profile. Data from new
  sources, whether inside or outside of Penn, should be checked carefully for
  identifiers in private tags. Flywheel can [de-identify private
  tags](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360024577194-How-to-de-identify-private-DICOM-tags)
  but requires extra steps to do so.

* Identifiers included in text fields such as ImageComments or StudyComments. The
  PatientComments tag is removed by the profile, others are not because they are often
  used to store image information or to route data to the correct location in Flywheel.
  Investigators should ensure that text fields are never used to store identifiers.

* Burned-in annotations. Clinical data may have patient information present in the pixel
  data. This needs special handling.

* Identifiers in non-DICOM imaging data. Identifiers may be present in other file types including NIFTI image data,
  ZIP archive metadata, and JSON sidecars. **Headers, images and metadata from any new
  source should be checked manually.**

* In some cases, metadata can be saved in a non-standard location. For example, some old
  data in Flywheel can have a `"metadata"` field with protected information in it.


## Further de-identification for data sharing

The site profiles do not remove all potential indirect identifiers. Information that
identifies the study date, scanner, or internal study identifiers can remain present in
the header.

Custom secondary de-identification is available through the [deid-export
](https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/flywheel-apps/deid-export) gear.


## Repository contents

* Example data containing synthesized PHI, that can be used to test import procedures.
  This data is derived from a publicly available de-identification test data set. If used
  in research, please include the citations in the README.

* A copy of the deidentification profile that is applied on import.

* Scripts to check flywheel metadata and dicom archives of data already uploaded to Flywheel.
